      The above map displays all earthquakes that have occurred in the last 24 hours. This map is updated every minute to provide the most recent data. These earthquakes have been symbolized according to their magnitude. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are shown as larger circles while lower magnitude earthquakes are indicated by smaller circles. Clicking on a specific earthquake will give information about its location and magnitude as well as a link to view further details about that quake.  More earthquake information available from the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/" target="_blank"> USGS Earthquake Hazards Program</a>. Data was retrieved from <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php" target="_blank"> here</a>.

        <p>All earthquakes that have occurred in the last week. Because this map includes many more earthquakes, the quakes are symbolized by color instead of size. The green hues indicate lower magnitudes while the redder hues indicate a higher magnitude. Clicking on a specific earthquake will give information about its location and magnitude as well as a link to view further details about that quake.
